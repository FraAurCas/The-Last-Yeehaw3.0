This is the best game ever created, called "The Last Yeehaw."

**You might not want to launch through actual build. At the moment there is no reset, so you would have to relaunch every time. You need to move the MonoBleedingEdge folder into the Builds folder and it might work. Just launch the Desert Cowboy scene in the scenes folder under Assets**
